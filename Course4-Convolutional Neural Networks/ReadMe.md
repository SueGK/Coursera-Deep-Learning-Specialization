## About this Course
In the fourth course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will understand how computer vision has evolved and become familiar with its exciting applications such as autonomous driving, face recognition, reading radiology images, and more.

By the end, you will be able to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks; apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks; and use neural style transfer to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data. 

The Deep Learning Specialization is our foundational program that will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. It provides a pathway for you to gain the knowledge and skills to apply machine learning to your work, level up your technical career, and take the definitive step in the world of AI.

## Week 1 Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks
Implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image classification problems.

## Week 2 Deep Convolutional Models: Case Studies
Discover some powerful practical tricks and methods used in deep CNNs, straight from the research papers, then apply transfer learning to your own deep CNN.

## Week 3 Object Detection
Apply your new knowledge of CNNs to one of the hottest (and most challenging!) fields in computer vision: object detection.

## Week 4 Special Applications: Face recognition & Neural Style Transfer
Explore how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition, then implement your own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!
